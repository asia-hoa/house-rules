Each condominium owner shall have the right to substitute new finished surfaces for the finished surfaces then existing on said ceilings, floors, and walls. However, such new finished surfaces shall not be installed without the prior written approval of the board of directors.  When substituting new finished flooring for existing flooring, an underlayment will need to be used in order to lower noise transmissions from hardwood floors to units below. Each owner shall also have the right to maintain, repair, paint, finish, alter, substitute, add or remove any fixtures attached to said ceilings, floors, and walls.

This section is intended to authorize each condominium owner to make reasonable repairs, alterations, and substitutions and to decorate or redecorate his or her condominium within reasonably accepted standards and taste, but shall not be construed to permit interference with or damage to structural integrity of the buildings, or interference with the use and enjoyment of the common elements or of the other condominiums.

#### Removal

Realtors must remove their key box when the associated sale listing is no longer active.

Attached key boxes or lock boxes which do not follow all the requirements set out by the Board may be removed without notice.

### Subletting

Maintaining a high level of owner occupancy promotes higher property values, protects our ability as individual owners to secure financing, and promotes a higher level of participation within the building community with regards to the current issues and overall well-being of the building.  

The Association’s Declarations does not limit the number of units that may be sublet at any one time.  However, tenants are subject to approval by the Board.  The approval process will include appropriate credit and background checks on the proposed tenants.

All leases are limited to 6 month terms, and require Board approval for renewal.

Absentee owners must keep the Property Building Manager advised of their current address and phone number in case of emergency. Owners who are landlords must give a copy of the lease to the Property Manager and all emergency contact information for the lessee.

Absentee owners must provide their lessee with a copy of the current House Rules and Regulations prior to the lessee's occupancy and the lessee will be responsible for conformance with these rules.  In the event the lessee is not in conformance with the rules, the owner will be held responsible for all fines incurred.

#### Lease Minimum Duration

Rental leases must be a minimum of six (6) months. No shorter terms are permitted. No short term rental services (Airbnb, VRBO, or others) may be offered. Fines for violating this provision will be incurred immediately, with requiring the owner first receive a warning.

### Trash / Recycling

#### Trash

All garbage and trash waste materials must be bagged using securely sealed plastic garbage bags and placed inside the dumpster. 

No trash is to be left in the storage locker rooms, the, garage or other common areas. No trash or littering is allowed around the exterior of the building. If the owner of the trash can be determined they will be fined.

Do not place large objects (i.e. furniture), car batteries, or hazardous materials etc. in the dumpster or recycle bins.  It is each respective owner’s legal responsibility to dispose of these items.  Failure to comply with this rule will result in a fine to the homeowner with no warning provision.

Residents are responsible for the proper off-site disposal of their construction refuse.  If in doubt, contact the Property Manager.

#### Recycling

All recyclable materials shall be placed in the recycle receptacle on each floor in the trash shoot rooms.  This includes glass, paper, and cans.  All cardboard boxes must be broken down before being placed in the dumpster.

Please note that while some plastic is recyclable, plastic bags may not be used as containers for recyclable material.  

### Violations / Fine Structure

Asia Condominium Association Board of Directors has the statutory authority to impose reasonable fines for violations of the House Rules, Declaration, By-laws and other governing documents.  However, due process, at a minimum, requires written notice of the alleged violation or complaint and an opportunity for a hearing before the Board.

Any allegation of violation or complaint must be signed and submitted to the Board or property management company in writing at least fourteen (14) days prior to the next scheduled Board meeting in order to be considered at that meeting.

Written notice will be forwarded by the Board or Property Management Company to the alleged violator with notice of the right to request a hearing.  The request for such a hearing must be in writing to the Board President within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of complaint or violation by the alleged violator.

If no hearing is requested, the Board will render a decision on the alleged violation or complaint at its next regularly scheduled meeting.  If a hearing is requested as stipulated above, the hearing for the Respondent to a complaint or alleged violation will be held at the regularly scheduled Board meeting immediately following a request for hearing.  The hearing will provide for objections or amendments to the complaint and the opportunity to provide certain evidence or discoveries relative to the complaint.

Both the Complainant and Respondent must appear at the hearing or risk default of their right to establish a violation or defend against the complaint respectively.

The Respondent will be given ten (10) days to prepare for the hearing.  If notice of complaint or request for hearing is made within ten (10) of the next scheduled Board meeting, then the hearing will be conducted at the next following meeting.

The hearing can be rescheduled with written notice to the Board President, notice subject to approval by the President.

The Hearing Board will be a quorum of the Board and will be impartial in their deliberations and resulting decisions.  If either party to the complaint feels that it is impossible for a particular board member to act impartially, the concerned party can request that a substitute Hearing Board member be selected.  A 24-hour notice must be given if substitution is desired.  The Board will designate a substitute as it determines necessary.

Written procedures for conduct of the actual hearing will be given prior to the hearing.

The decisions of the Hearing Board are final.

Non-payment of any fine or penalty within thirty (30) days after the decision has been reached by the Hearing Board and delivered by U.S. mail to the parties to the complaint will result in a lien being placed against the Owner's unit.  Again, penalty fines incurred by owners, tenants, children or guests of owners or tenants are the financial responsibility of the unit owner.

If legal actions are necessary to compel an owner to comply with the House Rules, By-laws, or Declaration, or in the collection of assessments, fines and fees or in the eviction of a tenant, then that owner shall be responsible for paying all attorneys fees and cost incurred in obtaining compliance.

- Collection Policy for Delinquent Assessments

The Board of Directors  has the authority and pursuant to Section 4.9 Powers and Duties of the Board, to set policy, including the charging of late fees, regarding the collection of Association Assessments, and

The Board of Directors recognizes the necessity for collection of delinquent assessments to the Association and

The Board of Directors requires a delinquent assessment collection process in order to assist routine operations and the following delinquency policies shall apply to all delinquent accounts;

01. Authority:  The Property Management Company is authorized to make collection of any delinquent assessments on behalf of the Association and the Board of Directors.

02. Written Notification:  All notification regarding delinquent accounts will be in writing.  All notification will include a contact name and phone number of the Property Management Company and/or the attorney handling the collection.

03. Assessment Due Date and Late Fee:  Assessments of any type are due on the first day of the month and shall be delinquent 10 days later.  A $25.00 late fee shall be assessed on all outstanding balances pursuant to and as contemplated by RCW 19.52.020.  This charge shall be applied after the 10th of each month.

    Any fines for non-compliance of the House Rules will be added to the unit owner’s account, and if needed will be collected as all other delinquent assessments.

    If necessary, the Board has the authority to increase late charges. The Property       Management Company may add a reasonable service fee for on going delinquent accounts.

    Any banking charges related to the return of a payment for non-sufficient funds will be assessed to the unit owner’s account.

04. Notification Process:  The Property Management Company will generate an automatic delinquency notice after an account has been delinquent for 30 days.

    After 60 days, if payment has not been received and the delinquency cured, the Property Management Company will notify the owner in writing in a demand for payment letter alerting the owner that if the account is not brought current the account will be turned over to a collection attorney

    Upon 90 days of unresolved delinquent account the management company will notify the collection attorney for the Association.

    The collection attorney will receive all supporting documentation.  This begins the attorney collection process, which may include the filing of a lien, but will take the collection avenue, which the collection attorney deems most appropriate.  The costs associated with collection measures will be added to any delinquent assessment amount owed by the owner in the manner outlined in the governing documents.

    All further communication and/or payment agreements will be negotiated with the attorney.  Should a payment agreement be entered upon with both parties (attorney and owner) and exceed 60 days and additional fee of a minimum of $200 will be assessed to the owners account.

    Any and all additional fees for lien processing, notification, office expenses, et. al will also be assessed to the unit owners account by the collection attorney as he deems fit.

    The Board retains the right in an unusual circumstance or special situation to determine a solution to the individual’s situation based on particular needs.

    This Resolution and process will supersede current collection policies.

    This resolution was approved by the Board of Directors on December 6, 2006 at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors and as recorded in the minutes of said meeting.
